                        <h2 style="text-align: center; ">Biography<br></h2>
						  <p style="text-align: center; "><br></p>
                            <p style="text-align: center;color:red;font-weight:700; ">Yung Trey, Born Marshall Bradley in Louisville, KY on September 27, 1990 is an ARTIST/ Rapper/ Songwriter signed with independent label Grind Hard Family. At the tender age of 12, Trey knew what he wanted to do for the rest of his life, and that’s make music! In middle school, you would always catch a rhyme or two on the back of a homework assignment, in notebooks, etc. Trey gained an early interest in rap and R&amp;B, which were influenced by artists such as Lil Wayne, The Game &amp; Ludacris.<br></p>
                    <p style="text-align: center ; "><br></p>
                            <p style="text-align: center ; color:grey ; font-weight:700; ">In the 8th grade at the age of 12 Trey began writing full songs and loved doing it. Trey and some of his closest friends started a group called Da Clique (which lasted a year?). Once the group broke up, Trey and a relative started a group called BMG (Blood Money) to represent us as blood brothers as family. By the time Trey turned 14 he wrote his first mixtape and recorded it all on a computer microphone. Once Trey turned 16 he took his music very serious and put out the mixtape Yung Trey Da Beast, which Trey sold throughout his high school of Fern Creek Traditional High. As time went on Trey kept working and dropping mixtapes. Once Trey graduated he put out his biggest mixtape, The Loui-Villain Vol. 1, which sparked a lot of buzz throughout Louisville.<br></p>
                                <p style="text-align: center; center;color:red;font-weight:700; ">Shortly after the Loui-Villain dropped BMG split up and Trey took a break from his music to focus on reality. In 2011 Trey had a daughter and as of 2012 Yung Trey is back to business with new label Grind Hard Family. Trey has yet to drop an official mixtape with Grind Hard Family but there’s plenty music available.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: center; "><br></p>
                            <p style="text-align: center ; color:white ; font-weight:700;">Yung Trey has continued to develop and mature as an artist. He’s learned that you don’t need to speak on all the negativity and that positivity can get you a long way. His music from 2013 sounds nothing similar to his latest mixtape The Loui-Villain. Trey’s hard work and work ethic speaks for itself. When he is at his 9 to 5, he is writing songs. When he isn’t at his 9 to 5, he is recording those songs.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: center; "><br></p>
                            <p style="text-align: center; color:red ; font-weight:700;">“I know that not everyone is going to like my music, but I will damn sure try to make everyone LOVE IT” Trey says. Full of positivity, Trey rather focuses on helping rather than damaging, giving back as opposed to taking. As hungry as Yung Trey is about putting his city on his back and his passion for music and his focus on making himself better, there is no doubt that Yung Trey will soon be a name that everyone knows and appreciates.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: center; "><br></p>
                            <p style="text-align: center; ">“Yung Trey” is connected to the audience and fans through Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, YouTube and Soundcloud.com. For booking and features contact Chuncey Bender at Grindhardfamily2@yahoo.com</p>
